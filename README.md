# Amazon.co.uk-spend-analysis
Do you want to know your total amazon.co.uk spend per year? Or is ignorance bliss?...

This is a python3 script that will analyse your amazon.co.uk order history to show you your spend per year as a bar chart.

Here is an example output:

![Example_spend_record](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33846419/188415042-258674c9-a9f8-4411-a683-d961ee378b30.png)


In order to use this script you need to download your amazon.co.uk order history. 
Unfortunately a feature to do this was removed from Amazon, back in 2018!
It is still available for amazon.com accounts for those in the USA!

However there is a github repository for a chrome extension to obtain this data easily form amazon.co.uk accoutns.
It can be found here:  https://github.com/philipmulcahy/azad#readme

Once the extension has been installed it can be used to download a csv of your order history for each year you are interested in. 
Place all csv's in the same folder for this script to work and add the path to the 'path' variable in the script. 

Then you simply need to run the python script!
